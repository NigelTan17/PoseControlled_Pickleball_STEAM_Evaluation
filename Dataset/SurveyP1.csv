"Timestamp","Age  ","Gender","School","  Have you played Pickleball before?  ","Experience with motion-based digital games (e.g. Nintendo Switch/Wii games)","Do you have experience with coding/programming?","The game helped me understand how body movement and reaction time affect performance. ","I became more aware of physical concepts (e.g. balance, coordination) while playing. ","The game encouraged me to experiment and observe how actions affect outcomes. ","I could connect the gameplay experience to real-world sports or science. ","The human pose detection worked effectively to support gameplay. ","The game technology (Unity + webcam) felt reliable and responsive. ","The use of real-time tracking increased my interest in digital technologies. ","I found the game easy to use without special hardware such as remote controller.","The system design (paddle, ball, scoring) was logical and easy to understand. ","The integration of components (pose detection, Unity, scoring) worked smoothly. ","The game demonstrated how system parts can interact to achieve results. ","Playing the game made me curious about how such systems are engineered. ","The visuals and graphics were appealing and enhanced my experience. ","The creativity of the game design made it more engaging. ","The sound and UI design improved immersion. ","The overall presentation motivated me to continue playing. ","I could see how scoring reflected mathematical calculations. ","The timing and angles of ball movement related to mathematical concepts. ","I understood how geometry (angles, trajectories) affects outcomes. ","I became more aware of quantitative aspects (speed, accuracy, score).","The game was enjoyable and motivated me to continue playing. ","I learned something new or gained insights through the gameplay. ","I believe this game could be useful in an educational or training setting. "
