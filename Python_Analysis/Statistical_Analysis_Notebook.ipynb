        "\n",
        "Overall, the results indicate that academic background plays a limited role in shaping how participants perceive the game’s STEAM-related learning value and general engagement. Although Technical students consistently recorded the highest median scores across most domains, and High School students showed noticeably lower ratings, these differences were only statistically significant for certain domains after post-hoc testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significant pairwise differences largely highlight that High School students tend to evaluate the game less favourably compared to university-level groups. This is expected, as High School participants may have less exposure to STEAM concepts, digital interfaces, or analytical reasoning tasks embedded in the gameplay.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, there were **no significant differences between Technical and Non-Technical university groups**, showing that the game delivers a comparable level of engagement and perceived learning value regardless of academic discipline. Foundation students displayed more variability but still remained broadly aligned with other groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, the results suggest that the digital pickleball game provides a generally **accessible, consistent, and inclusive** STEAM learning experience across different academic backgrounds. The game is effective in supporting engagement and perceived educational value for a diverse range of learners.\n"

Although minor mean differences were visible in the descriptive results, these differences were not strong enough to be considered meaningful.

        "### 7.3 Interpretation of Spearman Correlation Results\n",
        "\n",
        "All STEAM domains show **moderate-to-strong positive correlations** with General Engagement (ρ ≈ 0.70–0.80). This means that within this collected sample, students who give higher ratings in any STEAM component also tend to report higher overall engagement with the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Correlation Matrix shows:\n",
        "- **Arts (ρ ≈ 0.804)** shows the strongest association with General Engagement. Students who perceive strong creative or expressive value in the game tend to feel more engaged.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Technology (ρ ≈ 0.738)** and **Mathematics (ρ ≈ 0.741)** also show strong associations. Technical clarity, logical reasoning, and structured problem-solving may contribute to a positive experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Science (ρ ≈ 0.716)** and **Engineering (ρ ≈ 0.705)** show slightly lower but still meaningful correlations. These domains enhance engagement but to a slightly lesser degree than Arts/Tech/Math.\n",
        "\n",
        "- All STEAM domains are strongly correlated with one another (ρ ≈ 0.70–0.82), suggesting that students perceive the game’s educational components as interconnected rather than isolated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The heatmap reinforces these patterns by showing:\n",
        "- A consistent cluster of strong positive correlations across all domains  \n",
        "- No negative relationships anywhere  \n",
        "- Strong interrelationships among STEAM domains  \n",
        "- General Engagement positioned in the same correlation range as the STEAM components\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the correlation results show that students tend to rate the STEAM elements and their general engagement in a similar way. When they feel positively about one part of the game, they often feel positive about the others too. However, these patterns only reflect the responses of our XMUM participants and the high school students who have participated. They do not prove that one domain directly increases another, and they should not be treated as universal results.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the same study were carried out with different groups of students or at different institutions, the relationships between the domains might look different. Because of that, the correlations here should be viewed as insights into how this specific group experienced the game, not as conclusions that apply to everyone.\n",

        "# 8.0 Summary of Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "Across all analyses, the digital pickleball game demonstrates strong perceived educational value and consistent engagement among participants. All STEAM domains (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) recorded high mean scores (≥4.1) with narrow confidence intervals, indicating that participants generally agreed that the game supports various aspects of STEAM learning. The General Engagement domain achieved the highest average score (≈4.4), showing strong overall enjoyment, curiosity, and learning motivation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Group comparison results showed clear and statistically significant differences across academic backgrounds (School Groups). High School students consistently gave lower ratings compared to Technical and Non-Technical students across multiple domains, except for Technology where no significant differences were found. Dunn post-hoc tests further confirmed that:\n",
        "- High School scored significantly lower than Technical and Non-Technical across Science, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics, and General Engagement.\n",
        "- Foundation students did not differ significantly from most groups.\n",
        "- Technology showed no significant group differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings suggest that students with more advanced/higher academic exposure (e.g., Technical/Non-Technical) may recognise and appreciate the game’s educational elements more strongly than younger learners. This reinforces the need for difficulty balancing and clearer scaffolding for High School students in the final FYP implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, no statistically significant differences were found between:\n",
        "- Gender (Male vs Female)\n",
        "- Prior Pickleball Experience (Yes vs No)\n",
        "- Prior Motion-Game Experience (Yes vs No)\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates that the game provides a consistently accessible and enjoyable learning experience across these characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation analysis showed moderate-to-strong positive relationships between all STEAM domains and General Engagement (ρ ≈ 0.61–0.71). Domains like Arts, Technology, and Mathematics demonstrated the strongest associations, highlighting that when players perceive stronger educational value (creatively, technically, or logically) they also tend to feel more engaged.\n"

        "\n",
        "> 1. Sample Size and Group Imbalance\n",

        "\n",
        "All data were collected using Likert-scale self-reports. These responses may be influenced by mood, interpretation differences, or personal bias, meaning scores reflect perceived — not measured — learning value.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 3. No Gameplay Telemetry or Behaviour Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The study evaluates perceptions of learning but does not measure in-game behaviours (e.g., reaction time, hit accuracy, movement quality).\n",
        "Therefore, findings cannot confirm whether players’ perceived learning matches actual performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 4. Short-Term Exposure\n",
        "\n",
        "Most participants only played the game briefly. The novelty effect may have inflated engagement scores, and long-term learning retention was not assessed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Nearly all participants were from XMUM except those from the high school, limiting the diversity of perspectives.\n",
